# blockchain

This is a small repo in which I am following along creating a basic block chain in Go. The article is:

[Code your own blockchain in less than 200 lines of Go!](https://medium.com/@mycoralhealth/code-your-own-blockchain-in-less-than-200-lines-of-go-e296282bcffc)

Major changes include breaking up the code into files for better maintainability, fixing some best practices around JSON, and otherwise subjective changes. The Blockchain related logic is the same.
